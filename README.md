**Note:** Some of the detail in the posts above might not be up to date due to breaking changes in libraries used in this projects. See [#125](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app/pull/125).

The project is designed to **as simple as possible** for learning purpose. Due to its simplicity, aspects such as **security** must be reconsidered before being **used in production**.

<h3 align="center">Dependencies</h3>

This project uses the following dependencies:

- `next.js` - v9.3 or above required for **API Routes** and new [**new data fetching method**](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching#getserversideprops-server-side-rendering).
- `react` - v16.8 or above required for **react hooks**.
- `react-dom` - v16.8 or above.
- `swr` - required for state management
- `mongodb` - may be replaced by `mongoose`.
- `passport`, `passport-local` - required after [#39](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app/pull/39) for authentication
- `next-connect` - recommended if you want to use Express/Connect middleware and easier method routing.
- `express-session`, `connect-mongo` - required for session, may be replaced with other session libraries such as `cookie-session` or `next-iron-session`.
- `bcryptjs` - optional, may be replaced with any password-hashing library. `argon2` recommended.
- `validator` - optional but recommended.
- `multer` - may be replaced with any middleware that handles `multipart/form-data`
- `cloudinary` - optional, **only if** you are using [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) for image upload.
- `@sendgrid/mail` - optional, **only if** you are using [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) to send emails.

<h3 align="center">Environmental variables</h3>

Environmental variables in this project include:

- `MONGODB_URI` The MongoDB Connection String (with credentials)
- `EMAIL_FROM` The email address to send your emails from.
- `DB_NAME` The name of the MongoDB database to be used.
- `WEB_URI` The *URL* of your web.
- `SESSION_SECRET` (only if you use `express-session`) The secret to be used in `express-session`.
- `CLOUDINARY_URL` (optional, Cloudinary **only**) Cloudinary environment variable for configuration. See [this](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration#configuration).
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` (optional, SendGrid **only**) SendGrid API Key. See [this](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/).

<h3 align="center">Development</h3>

Start the development server by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. Getting started by create a `.env.local` file with the above variables. See [Environment Variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables).

#### `.env.local`

I include my own environment variables in [.env.example](.env.example) for experimentation purposes. Please replace them with your owns and refrain from sabotaging them. You can try them in development by renaming it into `.env.local`.

In production, it is recommended to set the environment variables using the options provided by your cloud/hosting providers. **Do not use or commit `.env.local`**.

It is at upmost importance that you do not reuse these variables in production. Especially, the database in use is public so its data is visible to all.

<h2 align="center">Deployment</h2>

This project can be deployed [anywhere Next.js can be deployed](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment). Make sure to set the environment variables using the options provided by your cloud/hosting providers.

After building using `npm run build`, simply start the server using `npm run start`.

You can also deploy this with serverless providers given the correct setup.
