## Using this project

Before getting started, I welcome you to read this [issue](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app/issues/13) on production readiness. The goal is not to use this project as it, but to implement your own version.

This project accompanies the following posts:

- https://www.hoangvvo.com/blog/full-fledged-app-with-next-js-and-mongodb-part-1/
- https://www.hoangvvo.com/blog/full-fledged-app-with-next-js-and-mongodb-part-2/

*Note*: **Part 1** and **Part 2** are written without [next-connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-connect) for middleware and method routing and only apply to commits before [db910c2](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app/tree/db910c259adb96494156b467834c65075ca90714).

The project is designed to as simple as possible for the purpose of learning. Due to its simplicity, aspects such as security must be reconsidered before being pushed to production.

### Environmental variables

The environment variables [will be inlined during build time](https://nextjs.org/docs#build-time-configuration) and thus should not be used in front-end codebase.

Required environmental variables in this project include:

- `process.env.MONGODB_URI` The MongoDB Connection String (with credentials)
- `process.env.EMAIL_FROM` The email address to send your emails from.
- `process.env.DB_NAME` The name of the MongoDB database to be used.
- `process.env.WEB_URI` The *URL* of your web.
- `process.env.CLOUDINARY_URL` (optional, Cloudinary **only**) Cloudinary environment variable for configuration. See [this](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration#configuration "Cloudinary Configuration").

### Development

Start the development server by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. The project supports using `.env`. Getting started by create a `.env` file with the above variables.

**Styles (CSS):** This project does not contain any stylesheets, and no component has classes. To remove the style, simply remove all `<style jsx>` and `<style jsx global>` tags.

#### `.env`

I include my own MongoDB, Cloudinary, SendGrid environment variables in [.env.example](.env.example) for experimentation purposes. Please replace them with your owns and refrain from sabotaging them. You can try them in development by renaming it into `.env`.

In production, it is recommended to set the environment variables using the options provided by your cloud/hosting providers. **Do not use or commit `.env`**.
