# Next.js + MongoDB App

A full-fledged app made with Next.JS and MongoDB.

## About this project

`nextjs-mongodb-app` is a continously developed app built with Next.JS and MongoDB. The project is designed to as simple as possible for the purpose of learning.

Give this project a big ol' ðŸŒŸ star motivates me to work on new features.

Check out the [demo](https://nextjs-mongodb-app.hoangvvo.now.sh/).

## Using this project

Before getting started, I welcome you to read this [issue](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app/issues/13) on production readiness. The goal is not to use this project as it, but to implement your own version.

This project accompanies the following posts:

- https://www.hoangvvo.com/blog/full-fledged-app-with-next-js-and-mongodb-part-1/
- https://www.hoangvvo.com/blog/full-fledged-app-with-next-js-and-mongodb-part-2/

*Note*: **Part 1** and **Part 2** are written without [next-connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-connect) for middleware and method routing and only apply to commits before [db910c2](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app/tree/db910c259adb96494156b467834c65075ca90714).

### Environmental variables

The environment variables [will be inlined during build time](https://nextjs.org/docs#build-time-configuration) and thus should not be used in front-end codebase.

Required environmental variables in this project include:

- `process.env.MONGODB_URI` The MongoDB Connection String (with credentials)
- `process.env.EMAIL_FROM` The email address to send your emails from.
- `process.env.DB_NAME` The name of the MongoDB database to be used.
- `process.env.WEB_URI` The *URL* of your web.
- `process.env.CLOUDINARY_URL` (optional, Cloudinary **only**) Cloudinary environment variable for configuration. See [this](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/node_integration#configuration "Cloudinary Configuration").
- `process.env.SENDGRID_API_KEY` (optional, SendGrid **only**) SendGrid API Key. See [this](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/api-keys/).
- `process.env.SENDGRID_TEMPLATEID_EMAILVERIFY` (optional, Sendgrid **only**) SendGrid Email Template to use.

I include my own MongoDB, Cloudinary, SendGrid environment variables in [.env.example](.env.example) for experimentation purposes. Please replace them with your owns and refrain from sabotaging them. You can try them in development by renaming it into `.env`.

In production, it is recommended to set the environment variables using the options provided by your cloud/hosting providers. **Do not use or commit `.env`**.

## Development

`nextjs-mongodb-app` is a long-term developing project. There is no constraint on numbers of features. I continuously accepts feature proposals and am actively developing and expanding functionalities.

Start the development server by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`. The project supports using `.env`. Getting started by create a `.env` file with the above variables.

### Features

There are three states in feature development:

#### Authentication

- Session management
- Allow users to sign up and log in/log out.

#### User profile

- Avatar, name, email, location, etc.
- User profile page
- Edit user profile

#### Account management

- Email verification
- Password change
- Password reset

#### Social `delayed`

- Find other users with search functionality
- View other users' profile page
- Add/Remove friends

Have any features in mind, [make an issue](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app/issues). Would like to work on a feature, [make a PR](https://github.com/hoangvvo/nextjs-mongodb-app/pulls).

### Styles

This project does not contain any stylesheets, and no component has classes. To remove the style, simply remove all `<style jsx>` and `<style jsx global>` tags.
